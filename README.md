# GrabScaleVR-Demo
 Simple template for scaling grabbed objects in VR and snapping them to meshes in the world (walls, tables, floors, etc)

 Also has Tilt Brush-esque controls for scaling and rotating the world when you are grabbing air.

Built in Unreal Engine 4.27 based on the existing VR Template
